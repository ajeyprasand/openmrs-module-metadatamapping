openmrs-module-metadatamapping
==============================
GOAL:-
=====
The goal of Metadata Mapping is to solve many of the problems around metadata management by providing an easy & explicit way for metadata within a system (encounter types, location, etc.) to be mapped to external vocubularies.

This module was initially developed by Rafal Korytkowski.

USES:-
=====
Developers and implementers can refer to metadata by its more human-friendly mapping (e.g., source + code) instead of having to manually manipulate UUIDs.
Implementations with multiple servers no longer need to synchronize metadata UUIDs across systems; rather, tools can be designed to use metadata mappings to define sameness of metadata across servers.
Modules can use metadata mappings to allow administrators to create new metadata or map to existing metadata as needed.


Happy coding!!!!!!!
cheers!!!!!
